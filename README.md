# GCN-based-RecSys
This repository contains the implementation of a recommender system leveraging the power of GraphSAGE and LightGCN. The system is designed to provide recommendations by effectively learning from graph-structured data.
## Features
- GraphSAGE Implementation: A versatile Graph Neural Network (GNN) model that generates low-dimensional embeddings for nodes by sampling and aggregating features from local neighborhoods.
- LightGCN Implementation: A simplified and efficient variant of Graph Convolutional Networks tailored for collaborative filtering, focusing on learning embeddings by leveraging user-item interactions.
- Data Preprocessing: Tools and scripts for preparing and transforming data into graph structures suitable for training the models.
- Training and Evaluation: Comprehensive training scripts with configurable parameters and evaluation metrics to assess the performance of the recommender system.
- Visualization: Utilities for visualizing the graph data and embeddings to gain insights into the modelâ€™s learning process.
